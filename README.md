## MST/TSP Calculator
------------------------------------------------------------

After downloading and extracting the zip, type `source run.sh` to begin compilation

To run the program:

./calculate -m \<mode_specified\> < \< mode_specified_file\>

There are three modes to this calculator:

1. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

2. Fast Traveling Sales Problem (FASTTSP)

3. Optimal Traveling Sales Problem (OPTTSP) -- WITH PRUNING

ex:


./calculate -m MST < MST_1.txt

./calculate -m FASTTSP < FASTTSTP_1.txt

./calculate -m OPTTSP < OPTTSP_1.txt
